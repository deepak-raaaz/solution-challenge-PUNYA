<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

PUNYA is a project developed for the 2024 Google Solution Challenge üåç, aimed at reducing food wastage and addressing hunger. By connecting food donors, NGOs, and delivery agents, the platform efficiently redistributes surplus food. With innovative features like 'Hungry Spots üçΩÔ∏è,' users can donate surplus food to specific local areas in need. This project directly contributes to the United Nations' goal of achieving Zero Hunger by 2030.

### Problem Statement
Over 1.2 billion people are suffering from hunger globally, while in India alone, massive quantities of food are wasted every day. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this issue, leading to food wastage in restaurants due to unpredictable business and lockdowns. On the other hand, many NGOs and communities face a severe shortage of food and resources.

### Impact
PUNYA aims to efficiently connect donors, NGOs, and delivery agents to combat hunger. By utilizing innovative features like 'Hungry Spots,' the platform enables seamless surplus food distribution, fostering localized impact and contributing to the global goal of achieving "Zero Hunger."

### Features
- **Donor, NGO, and Delivery Agent Registration**: The platform optimizes registration for all user types, ensuring an efficient and transparent process.
- **Food Availability Posting**: Donors can categorize and post surplus food details for NGOs to access.
- **Hunger Spots**: Users can mark specific areas where there is a need for food, ensuring targeted and efficient distribution.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: The platform provides real-time tracking for donations and deliveries.
- **Punya Coins**: Delivery agents earn rewards in the form of Punya Coins, encouraging sustained engagement.
